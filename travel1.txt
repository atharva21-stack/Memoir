     One of the main catches of the eye is the magnificent Andamans Coral reefs. And I was also particularly drawn by the natural forests, tribals and aquatic beings. For everyone looking for room to breathe cheerful air and freedom to visit the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, I recommend it.




10. Laskwadweep: The tourism of Lakshadweep is mostly focused on water sports. Scuba diving, snorkelling, parasailing, kayaking, sailing, snorkelling, fishing, water skiing and deep seas fishing are some of the sports you may do. Tours to surrounding islands like Bangaram, Thinnakara, Parali and Kalpitty can also be arranged.

Lakshadweep is the only area where coral reef formation can be found in India. They are really gorgeous and multi-hued. The water is so transparent that the colourful reefs can actually be seen through it. The presence of corals renders the water shallow and easy for beginners and youngsters to wade into. The rich marine life of the islands and the amazing development of coral reefs add only to the mystique. Remember that collecting the corals is a law-abiding crime, so battle against tentation.

In Lakshadweep the next thing to do is to enjoy the beach in every respect. Create castles with creamy sand, or just wet the sun and work on the perfect tan. The lagoons around the islands are a beautiful image. Make sure you're completely charged with your camera battery. All five minutes I couldn't help shooting pictures.

You are disappointed if your reason for visiting Lakshadweep is a party. On the islands there are not many parties and alcohol consumption is banned except in Bangaram. There's not a lot to eat in shops or fantastic restaurants. That said, some magnificent indigenous products from palm fronds and cocoon coir to be bought could be found.
